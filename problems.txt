1) When I create a react-app with: npx create-react-app its showing a dependency issue because React19 are not compatible with react testing library so I run:

npm config set legacy-peer-deps true

Then run:

npx create-react-app my-app

Explanation:
The --legacy-peer-deps flag was introduced with v7 as a way to bypass peerDependency auto-installation; it tells NPM to ignore peer dependencies and proceed with the installation anyway. This is how things used to be with NPM v4 through v6.


2) When my project was initially created and when I run npm start it gave me an error of depency ajv:

I also facing the same problem.
I can currently use:
npm install ajv --save-dev
as a workaround.

4) Database ke andr collections hoti hen or us collections ke andr documents hotey hen.
5) We use Mongoose, because it is a ODM (Object Data Modeling) and we use for Mongodb data use in Nodejs to make a structure, validated data.
